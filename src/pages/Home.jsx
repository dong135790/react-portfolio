    <p>My name is Justin Dong. I am currently a web developing student attending the Vanderbilt Bootcamp for web Development. I am super excited so show what projects I have created along with the skills obtained thoughout my journey</p>
    <p>I currently live in Kentucky and working in a restaurant. I have two pets, one dog named Coco and a cat named Shaula. I hope to one day gain enough experience so that employeers will be impressed with my projects where they would want me aid in their own projects.</p>
